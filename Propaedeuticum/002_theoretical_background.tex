\section{Antibiotic resistance}

Antibiotic resistance is definied as the the ability of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites resists the antimicrobial medicines like for example antibiotics \cite{who_antibiotic_resistance}. Most commonly used antibiotics are the so called $\beta$-lactam antibiotics which contain a $\beta$-lactam ring in their chemical structure \cite{bush2013}. This includes penicillin, cephalosporin and carbapenems, which are the most common antibiotics used today \cite{versporten2018}. The enzymes in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria which are responsible for the resistance are called $\beta$-lactamases. Through hydrolysis, the enzymes break the $\beta$-lactam ring, which is the key structure of the $\beta$-lactam antibiotics \cite{ambler1980}. The core structure of the $\beta$-lactam antibiotics is shown in Figure \ref{fig:beta_lactam_antibiotics}.

The strucure shown in number one is the core of penicillins and the second one is the core of cephalosporins. \textbf{Source:} Wikipedia $\beta$-lactam antibiotics article \cite{wikipedia_beta_lactam_antibiotics}}

The $\beta$-lactam antibiotics exert their bactericidal effect by targeting the bacterial cell wall. They mimic the the D-Ala-D-Ala moiety of the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, which is the main component of the cell wall in bacteria. The active site residue prevents cross-linking of the peptidoglycan strands, compromising the cell wall integrity. The weakend cell is not longer able to withstand the osmotic pressure, leading to the cell lysis and death \cite{kim2023}.
